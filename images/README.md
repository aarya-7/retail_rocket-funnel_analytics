## Dashboard Images 

### 1) OVERVIEW.png — Funnel Health Snapshot
- **Conversion Rates (left):** Three key ratios:
  - **View -> Cart** = how often browsing turns into intent.
  - **Cart -> Txn** = checkout effectiveness once intent exists.
  - **View -> Txn** = end-to-end conversion.
- **KPI Cards (right):** Session counts for each stage + stage-to-stage counts (so you can see absolute volume, not just %).
- **Stage Counts (bottom bar):** Visual scale of where volume drops off (usually the fastest way to spot the biggest “leak”).

**How to read:** If View -> Cart is low but Cart -> Txn is strong, the main problem is *getting people to cart*, not checkout.



### 2) Segment Funnel.png — Conversion Isn’t Uniform
- Breaks funnel performance into **segments** (ex: new vs returning, hour bands, categories depending on how you built the view).
- Helps answer: “Which cohort behaves differently, and where?”

**How to read:** Look for segments that have:
- High traffic but weak conversion (big upside),
- Or low traffic but unusually strong conversion (potential to scale).



### 3) FOCUS HERE.png — Heatmap + Best/Worst Categories
- **Heatmap (top):** Conversion intensity by **Session Hour × Visitor Type** (new vs returning). Darker = higher conversion.
- **Top Categories (left bar):** Categories with the **highest View → Txn %** (with enough sessions to be trusted).
- **Worst Categories (right bar):** Categories with **lowest View → Txn %** (also sample-size filtered).

**How to read:**
- Heatmap shows *timing + audience behavior* (when returning users convert best).
- Top/Worst categories show *what to promote vs what to fix* (merchandising + UX issues).



### 4) Drop offs, Time_to_ convert.png — Speed + Friction Diagnostics
- **Time to convert (histogram):** Distribution of **minutes from first view to first purchase** (shows fast conversions vs long consideration tail).
- **Drop-off after cart (bottom-left):** Categories where users add to cart but don’t purchase (checkout friction, price shock, shipping, trust).
- **Drop-off after view (bottom-right):** Categories where users view but don’t move forward (weak product page, irrelevant traffic, poor discovery).

**How to read:**
- A tall left side on the histogram = many “quick deciders.”
- Long right tail = “researchers” (retargeting + comparison content opportunity).
- High drop-off-after-view categories = fix discovery/content first.
- High drop-off-after-cart categories = fix checkout + pricing/trust levers.
